Object Oriented Programming :
Merits over functional: helps to hide data variables from classes which are directly communicating with en user. Good for security
                        Inheritence
                        Polymorphism
                        Advantages : modularity and reuseability

Objects : encapsulation of method + class variables + instance variables

class : blueprint of an object

Abstract data type : It is a type/class of an object whose behaviour is defined with a set of methods and a set of data structures. 
The implementation of the methods is hidden or abstracted from the end user
Eg: List ADT, Stack ADT

Encapsulation : packaging data structures and methods into a single entity

Polymorphism : many forms, ability of object to take on many forms
Types:
1. Pure : Single function, multiple interpretations
2. Ad hoc: overloading - different functions with same name different arguments

Inheritence : reuseability of functions from a more generalized class
Types:
1. Single
2. Multi-level
3. Hierarchal
4. Hybrid (not in Java)

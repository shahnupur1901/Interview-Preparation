Start phase : Obtain permission for locks
Growing phase : acquire locks, not release them
shrinking phase : release locks not acquire
lock point : where final lock is acquired/first lock unlocked. The lock point order is serializabilty order.
These phases occur to each transaction not complete schedule!
Can generate irrecoverable / cascading rollbacks (dirty reads may be present with wrong commit order)
No assurance from deadlock 
conflict serializability present

1. Strict 2 phase locking : Hold all exclusive locks till commit/abort (NOT SHRINKING PHASE BUT TILL COMMIT/ABORT), no cascading rollbacks
2. Rigorous 2 phase locking : Hold all locks till commit/abort

Growing phase : acquire locks, not release them
shrinking phase : release locks not acquire
lock point : where final lock is acquired/first lock unlocked. The lock point order is serializabilty order.
These phases occur to each transaction not complete schedule!
Can generate irrecoverable / cascading rollbacks (dirty reads may be present with wrong commit order)
No assurance from deadlock 
-we have conflict serializability

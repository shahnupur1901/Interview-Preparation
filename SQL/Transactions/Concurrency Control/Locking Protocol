For consistency, isolation is an important idea. 
Locking achieves isolation.
To perform an operation on a data item :
request for a lock
lock it
perform
unlock it
For concurrency with isolation, different modes of locks are used.

1. Shared mode : lock-S instruction
  lock-S(Q)
  only read operation
  any transaction can read at the same time. 
2. Exclusive mode : lock-X
  lock-X(Q)
  1 transaction can perform read/write operation. No other transaction can access the data item in any other mode.
  
  Compatibility table :
  
                    Shared          Exclusive
  
  Shared            True            False
  
  Exclusive         False           False
  
  
  Can have
  -no serializability
  -inconsistency

Unit of program execution to access or update data
1. Atomicity :
Either all operations of transactions or none are reflected in the database.

2. Consistency :
Consistent database at start and end of transaction
Consistency requirements:
1. Explicitly specified integrity constraints
  -primary key
  -foreign key
2. Implicit integrity constraints
  - cash in hand = sum of balances - sum of loans

3. Isolation
Although multiple transactions occur concurrently, each transaction must be unaware of the other. Intermediate transaction results must be hidden.

4. Durability
After a successful transaction, the changes to the database must persist even if there are any system failures.

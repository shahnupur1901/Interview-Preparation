1. Get a recursive function and make it work.
  - visualize as a tree
  - implement tree into recursion. leaf : base case
  - test it
2. Make it efficient.
 - Add a new Object memo like set, map and make sure it is shared.
 - add a base case memo to check if it is in the object.
 - store return values and check that out
